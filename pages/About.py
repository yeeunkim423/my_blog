So I'll wait for you, love.  
And I'll burn.  
Will I ever see your sweet return?  
Oh, will I ever learn?  
Oh-oh, lover, you should've come over.  
'Cause it's not too late.

I don't wanna get undressed  
For a new person all over again.  
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck  
And have to pretend it's yours instead.  
And I don't wanna learn another scent.  
I don't want children of another man to have the eyes of the girl I won't forget.

And if my wishes came true, it would've been you.  
In my defense, I have none.  
For never leaving well enough alone.  
But it would've been fun, if you would've been the one.

Alexander's lover.  
Now my riverbed has dried.  
Shall I find no other?

I'm searching for something that I can't reach  
I don't like them innocent  
I don't want no face fresh  
Want them wearing leather  
Begging, let me be your taste test  
I like the sad eyes, bad guys  
Mouth full of white lies  
Kiss me in the corridor  
But quick to tell me goodbye  
You say that you're no good for me  
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve  
And I swear I hate you when you leave  
I like it anyway  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
What happened to the soul you used to be?  
You're a Rolling Stone boy  
Never sleep alone boy  
Got a million numbers  
And they're filling up your phone, boy  
I'm off the deep end, sleeping  
All night through the weekend  
Saying that I love him but  
I know I'm gonna leave him  
You say that you're no good for me  
'Cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve  
And I swear I hate you when you leave  
I like it anyway  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
What happened to the soul that you used to be  
I'm searching for something that I can't reach  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
I can't find you in the body sleeping next to me  
My ghost  
Where'd you go?  
What happened to the soul that you used to be

And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody.  
It won't leave my head.  
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine.  
But I wish I was dead (dead, like you)

I had all and then most of you  
Some and now none of you.  
Take me back to the night we met.  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,  
Haunted by the ghost of you.  
Oh, take me back to the night we met.
