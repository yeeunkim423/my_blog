So I'll wait for you, love.  
And I'll burn.  
Will I ever see your sweet return?  
Oh, will I ever learn?  
Oh-oh, lover, you should've come over.  
'Cause it's not too late.

        "url": "https://youtu.be/fOQ_-gZsnYQ",
        "lyrics": """
I don't wanna get undressed  
For a new person all over again.  
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck  
And have to pretend it's yours instead.  
And I don't wanna learn another scent.  
I don't want children of another man to have the eyes of the girl I won't forget.

And if my wishes came true, it would've been you.  
In my defense, I have none.  
For never leaving well enough alone.  
But it would've been fun, if you would've been the one.

Like Hephaestion, who died  
Alexander's lover.  
Now my riverbed has dried.  
Shall I find no other?

You say that you're no good for me.

I like it anyway.

And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody.  
It won't leave my head.  
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine.

I had all and then most of you  
Some and now none of you.  
Take me back to the night we met.  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,  
Haunted by the ghost of you.  
Oh, take me back to the night we met.
